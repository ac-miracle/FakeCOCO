**Comparison of `FakeCOCO` with existing benchmark.**

<p align="center"><img src="docs/Comparison with existing benchmark.jpg" width="800"/></p>
To better understand the characteristics of our dataset, we visualized both FakeCOCO and GenImage for a side-by-side comparison. The key difference lies in their prompt sources:


- FakeCOCO (Ours): Generated from detailed COCO captions, capturing the complexity and context of real-world scenarios.

- GenImage: Generated from simple ImageNet class names, which usually focus on a single object.

As a result, our generated images tend to portray multifaceted scenes with multiple objects, diverse textures, and intricate interactions, allowing them to better simulate the real world.

### Download
The proposed dataset "FakeCOCO" has been released on modelscope.
